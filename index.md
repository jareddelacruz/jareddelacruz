### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

    My personal all-time favorite lab was Lab 10 part 1 and 2. 
    Lab 10 was my favorite because it was the perfect mix of challenging 
    and simple. I was able to write code that I had recently learned
    from the lectures and use my knowledge effectively.

* Lab 2
    
    Lab 2 part 1 is another favorite of mine because it was a great introduction
    into coding. At the time it was a little difficult, but looking back,
    Lab 2 was extremely simple. I was able to create a math equation in code
    for the first time.

* Lab 5
    
    One last favorite lab of mine is Lab 5 part 1! It's one my personal favorites
    because it was one of the first labs that introduced user inputs and user 
    inputs are typically very fun to code around. I was able to learn quickly
    how to utilize std::cin and std::cout in this lab.
